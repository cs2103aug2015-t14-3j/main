Deleting Tasks
The command to delete a task is ‘delete’ followed by the indexes of the task to be removed from the last 'display' command

e.g.
display (displays all incomplete tasks)

  Description          Start Date         End Date
1.Submit report                           10/9/2015
2.Do CE4                                  1/1/2020
3.Go for a Jog

delete 3 would delete the third task (Go for a Jog)

Specifying multiple numbers will delete multiple tasks

i.e. delete 1 2 will delete the first and second task
